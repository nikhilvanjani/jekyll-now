Back from holidays. Meanwhile I found out some way to boot into my system but that's temporary. I can't shut down the system. I sparsely remember whatever I had tried last time to get it going. So, started afresh today and consciously so as to prevent some mishap from my side in installation. But, I still can't get through with it. This is frustrating now. When I configure the setup, it says some files are missing from a directory, but the files are there in it. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling completely but still can't break through with it.
