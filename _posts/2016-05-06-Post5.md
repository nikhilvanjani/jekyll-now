So now I have to implement the same in Google's Tensorflow. Read about what tensorflow is and it's features like displaying computations as graphs and it's ability to do parallel processing of different tasks. Installed CPU enabled tensorflow on my laptop. Tried installing GPU enabled version but facing some problems. Hopefully I should get it done soon.
