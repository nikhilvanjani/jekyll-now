No effective progress today. Still trying to install GPU enabled tensorflow. Took help of Adarsh to get it done but still we are facing some problems. Apparently it has got something to do with the CUDA and cuDNN version compatibilities. Newer versions have released but the website asks to install older versions but again, there seem some problem with the file names because we are installing from the sources. And now, my system is facing booting issues too because i have changed some system bash files for the installation. Nothing seems going correct really.
