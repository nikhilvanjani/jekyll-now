title: Day 8 - 25/5/16

The only motivation that keeps me going is that with GPU enabled version, I would be able to cover up for the time spent in installign it. Till now, mostly I was trying to resolve the problem myself. Today I tried to get help from youtube videos for installion but the videos available are old. Not with the updated versions. Also, somewhere I read that the configure file is hard-coded with CUDA version 7.0 but we have to install 7.5 . Few suggestions are to install the older versions and apparently the tensorflow website has updated instructions to the newer version since I have come back from vacations. This is crazy now. Very few resources are available on the web for various problems during installaion. I asked for guidace from my mentors lately. They asked me to get going with the CPU version only as the performance enhancement won't be much with laptops though I have a poweful graphics card. But, the good thing is, they also told that I should get GPUs available in CSE labs assigned to myself and try the installation later. Phew. I hope the efforts don't go in vain in the long run.
