title: Day 9 - 26/5/16
---
Going forward with CPU enabled Tensorflow, another hurdle upfront. Have to get the system booting corrected. Apparently, system doesn't load the NVIDIA graphics card. All day was spent in getting my system work properly. It does now but only with standard boot. Anyway, it will do for now.
